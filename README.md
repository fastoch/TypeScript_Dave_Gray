## Intro

TypeScript is a subset of JavaScript that can be used to write frontend code, and it can also be used to write backend code.  
**TypeScript compiles to JavaScript** - and that makes it available for **React** projects, **Node.js** projects, and more!  

This free 8 hour TypeScript course has 17 chapters and focuses on frontend development with TypeScript.  
Chapters 1-11 are for learning TypeScript fundamentals and chapters 12-17 cover TypeScript with React.
